# Code-Quiz

## The Task

This week's homework was to make a quiz that was responsive, alerted the user when they chose an answer and stored the highscores of all the players. The app uses a combination of timers and conditional statements directly affecting HTML and CSS to run.

Regrettably, the local-storage highscores don't remain after the page refreshes. It stays there while within the single run-time only. Would love some feedback on this in order to improve here.

## Process and Strategy

Essentially, the user needs to move through the quiz on a set pathway. As the code is fairly small, it's easy to presume how the user will interact with the code and the limited number of buttons. And this process based the build-up of the JS code, which does all the heavy lifting. Hence it carries all of the comments and thought processes behind the choices made (that and all of the long comment titles).
