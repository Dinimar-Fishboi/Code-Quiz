## The Application

This application runs the user through a fast-paced quiz to test their knowledge on JavaScript. 

## Technology
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## Process and Strategy

Essentially, the user needs to move through the quiz on a set pathway. As the code is fairly small, it's easy to presume how the user will interact with the code and the limited number of buttons. And this process based the build-up of the JS code, which does all the heavy lifting. Hence it carries all of the comments and thought processes behind the choices made (that and all of the long comment titles).
